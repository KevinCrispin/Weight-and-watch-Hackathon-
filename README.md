Contains code for a smart Traffic Light system which can play games while you wait

Light changes every 10 seconds based on Traffic density 

There is a 0.3 probability of there being an ambulance behind you, in which case you cannot play the game and have to move out of their way even if it is a red light

Shows games to play while the light is red 

Immediately returns back to traffic lights if light turns green 

It has two game modes: Student Mode and Teacher mode

Student mode includes a reaction speed tester game 
Teacher mode includes a descrambling game
